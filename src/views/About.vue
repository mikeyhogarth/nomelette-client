        <p>
          Years ago my grandmother, Sheila Hogarth, used to teach recipe classes
          in the Carlisle and Cumbria area. Her years of expertise in the
          kitchen saw her become the author of around a thousand recipes and
          adaptations covering many types of cullinary genre, from delicious
          starters to mouthwatering desserts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sheila passed away in 2000. Her archive of recipes (both compilations
          and hundreds of hand-written recipes) passed on to my parents and I
          thought it might be a nice idea to put them on the internet rather
          than letting them gather dust in the loft.

        <p>
          Traditional, old-school family recipes - not entirely unhealthy... but
          mostly they are! They're being shared to keep them alive. These days
          people are a little more concious about nutrition and calories, so
          this is just a fair warning that this is
          <em>not</em> what Nomelette is offering.

        <p>
          You may also see certain comments throughout the site with a "(sic)"
          aside - we copied down the recipes exactly as written, so if Sheila
          had made a throwaway comment about a recipe being "a good idea for a
          millenium party" then that's what it'll say on the site, despite the
          fact that the millenium has been and gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are also a few comments which haven't aged very well, but
          they've been left in too - nothing too bad but it doesn't really
          feel right to censor them :)
